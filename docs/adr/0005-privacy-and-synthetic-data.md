# ADR-0005: Privacy by design; all reference data is synthetic

| Field | Value |

| Standard traceability | ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 (architecture decision record) |

## Context

A public reference core must be safe to clone, demo and audit. ISO 27002 A.5.34.

## Decision

Audience personal data stays in adopter platforms; this core manages content, rights and schedules. Content identifiers are internal or registry codes; all data is synthetic. Internal keys are UUIDs and no real personal or confidential data ever enters this repository.

## Consequences

Correlation with production records happens through the adopter's governed processes, not this API.
